## Background

Nowadays, the speed of the technology development like it’s accelerating, it can be measured in the “returns” of the technology—such as speed, efficiency, price-performance, and overall “power”—which improve exponentially too.

However, fast pace acceleration bring side effect to all engineers, we are exhausted to adapt, to learn, to try new tech, we are running out of our energy, time, and mental loads, which lead us slowing down our work.

When we sit in front of out computer, face so many technologies out there, we need to deal with Github, Jenkins, cloud service, deployment pipeline, confluence documents and so on, daily, we have spent so much time on context switching, debugging, repeat the work that other people have already done, how frustrating is that !

## Dashpad

What is Dashpad?

Dashpad is a hackable universal desktop dashboard framework for your automation task and visualize tooling.

This framework aims to solve out problem we are having, we write scripts, tools or pipeline once, make it configurable, with nice user interface, and share them with other engineers, they can reuse the work that we've done, they can spend more time on focusing other areas they are familiar with. 

Every scripts or tools are meant to solve some sort of problems, witch mean we can gather different sector of engineers together who is facing same problem, as a problem solving group. 

With Dashpad, we can make tools, write scripts or pipeline, and port it to a desktop dashboard ui, and share it cross their network/sector, eventually everyone will benefit from it.
